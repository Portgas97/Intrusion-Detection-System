# Intrusion-Detection-System
Project of the course 'Artificial Intelligence for Cybersecurity'. The project is a complete binary-class classification problem based on the UNSW-NB15 dataset 
in which different machine learning algorithms were tested, evaluated and validated. In the end, there is also an approach for the multi-class classification problem.
